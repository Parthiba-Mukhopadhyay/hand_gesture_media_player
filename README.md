# Hand Gesture Controlled Media Player

This project is a hand gesture controlled media player that allows users to control media playback using hand gestures. It utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize and interpret hand gestures, enabling users to interact with the media player in a more intuitive and immersive way.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: The media player uses computer vision algorithms to detect and recognize hand gestures performed by the user.
- **Media Playback Control**: Users can control various media playback functions such as play, pause, stop, forward, and rewind using hand gestures.
- **Volume Control**: Hand gestures can be used to adjust the volume of the media player.
- **Gesture Customization**: Users can define and customize their own hand gestures for specific media player actions.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: The media player provides a user-friendly interface that displays the current media playback status and other relevant information.

## Requirements

To run the hand gesture controlled media player, you will need the following:

- **Hardware**:
  - A computer with a camera (built-in or external) for capturing hand gestures.
  - Adequate processing power to run the computer vision algorithms and media player software smoothly.

- **Software**:
  - Operating system: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
  - Python (version 3.6 or higher) and the necessary dependencies.
  - OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.
  - Media player software or online media player for handling media playback (e.g., VLC, Pygame, etc.).

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Parthiba-Mukhopadhyay/hand_gesture_media_player
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the media player software or library to work with the project. Refer to the respective documentation for instructions.

4. Connect a camera to your computer or ensure that the built-in camera is functional.

## Usage

1. Launch the hand gesture controlled media player by running the main script:

   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

2. Position your hand in front of the camera and perform the predefined hand gestures to control the media playback.

3. The media player interface will display the current status and respond to your hand gestures accordingly.

4. Customize the hand gestures by modifying the gesture recognition configuration file.

## Customization

To customize the hand gestures and their associated actions, follow these steps:

1. Open the gesture recognition configuration file (`config.json`) in a text editor.

2. Modify the existing gesture definitions or add new ones as needed. Each gesture definition consists of:
   - A unique gesture ID
   - A name or label for the gesture
   - The hand gesture pattern or sequence to be recognized

3. Save the changes and restart the media player for the modifications to take effect.
